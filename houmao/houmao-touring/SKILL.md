# Houmao Touring

Use this Houmao skill only when the user explicitly asks for `houmao-touring` or clearly asks for a first-time guided Houmao tour. This is a manual guided tour skill, not the default entrypoint for ordinary direct-operation requests.

`houmao-touring` is intentionally above the direct-operation skills. It inspects current Houmao state, explains the current posture in plain language, offers the next likely branches, and routes the selected work to the maintained Houmao-owned skill that owns that surface.

The trigger word `houmao` is intentional. Use the `houmao-touring` skill name directly when you intend to activate this Houmao-owned skill.

## Help

When the user asks `$houmao-touring help`, `help for houmao-touring`, `usage for houmao-touring`, `available functionality for houmao-touring`, or what this skill can do, answer from this section before presenting the welcome, inspecting state, choosing a branch page, routing to another skill, command execution, or missing-input questions. This is read-only help: do not run commands, mutate files, send mail, change gateway state, or alter managed-agent lifecycle state during help. If the user asks a concrete task such as "help me tour this Houmao project", route to the guided tour instead of stopping at generic help.

Purpose: provide a manual guided Houmao tour that starts from current state and routes selected work to maintained direct-operation skills.

Available functionality:

- Orient from current project, specialist, profile, managed-agent, mailbox, and gateway state.
- Guide quickstart, setup, author-and-launch, live-operations, advanced-usage, and lifecycle-follow-up branches.
- Explain likely next branches in first-time-user-friendly language.
- Route actual work to the Houmao skill that owns the selected surface.

Common starting prompts:

- `$houmao-touring help`
- `$houmao-touring start a guided tour`
- `$houmao-touring orient me in this project`
- `$houmao-touring show advanced usage options`

Related skills and boundaries:

- Use direct-operation skills such as `houmao-project-mgr`, `houmao-agent-definition`, `houmao-mailbox-mgr`, `houmao-agent-messaging`, `houmao-agent-gateway`, `houmao-agent-inspect`, and `houmao-agent-instance` for ordinary narrow tasks.
- Use `houmao-agent-loop-lite` or `houmao-agent-loop-pro` for current loop authoring and generated loop operation.
- Use `houmao-adv-usage-pattern` for elemental multi-skill mailbox or gateway patterns.
- Do not use this skill as the default entrypoint when the user did not ask for a guided tour.

## Welcome Message

When the user starts the guided tour, present a welcome message that adapts to the inspected current Houmao state. Keep the welcome user-facing and never imply that the user must restart from the beginning when Houmao state already exists. Do not repeat the welcome on every turn; if the recent conversation already covered it, skip it and proceed with the current-state orientation.

### Full welcome (blank-slate workspace)

Present the full welcome only when the workspace has no project overlay, no reusable specialists, and no running managed agents. Use the following baseline:

Welcome to Houmao. Houmao is a framework and CLI toolkit for orchestrating teams of loosely coupled CLI-based AI agents such as Claude, Codex, and Gemini. Each agent is a real CLI process with its own disk state, memory, and native TUI; Houmao coordinates the team through reusable specialists, mailbox messaging, per-agent gateways, and loop plans.

A typical first setup path is:

1. Create or inspect a Houmao project and initialize the mailbox root.
2. Create a specialist: customize its system prompt, choose the provider/tooling posture, and select credentials.
3. Create an optional launch profile: set the agent name, working directory, launch defaults, and any extra system prompt customization.
4. Set up and register the agent mail account.
5. Launch the agent. The default tour posture is a visible TUI managed agent with a foreground gateway sidecar; when mailbox is ready, enable gateway mail-notifier polling every 5 seconds so the agent can process new mail.

Start by checking what already exists here, then suggest the next likely branch instead of restarting from scratch.

### Short acknowledgement (workspace already has state)

Present a short one-to-two-sentence acknowledgement in place of the full welcome whenever the inspected workspace already has any of: a project overlay, one or more reusable specialists, one or more running managed agents. Follow it immediately with the current-state orientation and the offered next branches from the orient branch's posture-to-branch matrix. Do not push the user back into the full initial setup sequence in that case.

## Scope

This packaged skill covers a branching guided tour for:

- current-state orientation
- project overlay setup or inspection
- project-local mailbox setup or inspection
- specialist creation
- optional easy-profile creation
- easy-instance launch
- post-launch prompt entry
- post-launch read-only inspection or screen watching
- ordinary mailbox send or read entry
- gateway mail-notifier follow-up when a live gateway and mailbox are both ready
- reminders
- advanced loop creation guidance through `houmao-agent-loop-lite` or `houmao-agent-loop-pro`
- managed-agent inspection, stop, relaunch, and cleanup follow-up

This packaged skill does not cover:

- ordinary direct-operation requests that the user did not ask to route through the tour
- low-level command ownership for project, mailbox, specialist, messaging, gateway, loop-planning, or lifecycle actions
- ad hoc filesystem editing under `.houmao/`, runtime, or mailbox paths
- destructive cleanup as an automatic side effect of stop

## Workflow

Before starting the workflow, answer explicit skill-help intent from `## Help` and stop.

1. Confirm that the user explicitly wants the guided touring experience instead of one narrow direct-operation task.
2. Present the welcome message, including the typical first setup path, unless the recent conversation already covered it.
3. Choose one `houmao-mgr` launcher for the current turn:
   - first run `command -v houmao-mgr` and use the `houmao-mgr` already on `PATH` when present
   - if that lookup fails, use `uv tool run --from houmao houmao-mgr`
   - only if the PATH lookup and uv-managed fallback do not satisfy the turn, choose the appropriate development launcher such as `pixi run houmao-mgr`, repo-local `.venv/bin/houmao-mgr`, or project-local `uv run houmao-mgr`
   - if the user explicitly asks for a specific launcher, follow that request instead of the default order
4. Start from current-state orientation rather than assuming the tour begins at project initialization:
   - inspect project posture through `houmao-mgr project status`
   - inspect reusable specialists through `houmao-mgr project easy specialist list` or `houmao-mgr project easy specialist get --name <name>` when the branch needs them
   - inspect reusable profiles through `houmao-mgr project easy profile list` or `houmao-mgr project easy profile get --name <name>` when the branch needs them
   - inspect running managed agents through `houmao-mgr agents list`
   - inspect one live managed agent through `houmao-mgr agents state`, `houmao-mgr agents gateway status`, or `houmao-mgr agents mail resolve-live` when the branch needs live capability
5. Explain the current posture in plain language and offer the next likely branches.
6. Load exactly one branch page for the next selected tour branch:
   - `branches/orient.md`
   - `branches/quickstart.md`
   - `branches/setup-project-and-mailbox.md`
   - `branches/author-and-launch.md`
   - `branches/live-operations.md`
   - `branches/advanced-usage.md`
   - `branches/lifecycle-follow-up.md`
7. Route execution to the maintained Houmao-owned skill that owns the selected branch.
8. After that branch completes, summarize the new current state and offer the next likely branches again.

## Branches

- Read [branches/orient.md](branches/orient.md) to inspect current Houmao posture and present the next likely tour branches from the posture-to-branch routing table.
- Read [branches/quickstart.md](branches/quickstart.md) when the user wants a minimum-viable path to one running managed agent; the branch detects available host tool CLIs and routes authoring and launch through the maintained skills.
- Read [branches/setup-project-and-mailbox.md](branches/setup-project-and-mailbox.md) when the user wants project overlay setup or optional project-local mailbox setup.
- Read [branches/author-and-launch.md](branches/author-and-launch.md) when the user wants to create specialists or profiles, or launch another agent.
- Read [branches/live-operations.md](branches/live-operations.md) when the user wants to prompt a running agent, inspect live state or screen posture, send mailbox work, enable automatic mailbox polling through the gateway, or create reminders.
- Read [branches/advanced-usage.md](branches/advanced-usage.md) when the user wants a flat enumeration of the broader advanced Houmao feature surface, including lite loop authoring, pro loop authoring, advanced-usage patterns, memory, gateway extras, credential management, and low-level agent definition.
- Read [branches/lifecycle-follow-up.md](branches/lifecycle-follow-up.md) when the user wants to inspect, stop, relaunch, or clean up managed-agent sessions.

## References

- Read [references/question-style.md](references/question-style.md) when the tour needs to ask for user input in a first-time-user-friendly way with explanations, examples, and recommended defaults or skip options.
- Read [references/concepts.md](references/concepts.md) when the tour needs a compact self-contained glossary for the vocabulary used across branches (specialist, easy profile, launch profile, managed agent, recipe, tool adapter, gateway, gateway sidecar, mailbox root, mailbox account, principal id, user agent, master, loop plan, relaunch, cleanup).

## Routing Guidance

- Route project overlay setup or explanation to `houmao-project-mgr`.
- Route mailbox administration to `houmao-mailbox-mgr`.
- Route specialist or profile authoring, `create-agent-fast-forward`, and easy-instance launch to `houmao-agent-definition`.
- Route generic managed-agent inspection, live screen watching, mailbox-posture inspection, and runtime artifact inspection to `houmao-agent-inspect`.
- Route ordinary prompt or mailbox-routing entry for running agents to `houmao-agent-messaging`.
- Route gateway watch, gateway mail-notifier, and reminder work to `houmao-agent-gateway`.
- Route ordinary mailbox send, read, reply, or archive follow-up to `houmao-agent-email-comms`.
- Route lightweight Markdown/direct-SQL loop authoring, validation, and generated loop execution to `houmao-agent-loop-lite` when the user explicitly asks for lite or no-harness Markdown loops.
- Route schema-rich loop authoring, generated execplan validation, topology-heavy planning, and generated loop execution to `houmao-agent-loop-pro`.
- Present tree-loop and generic-loop as topology choices inside `houmao-agent-loop-pro`, not as separate skill packages.
- Route elemental immediate driver-worker edge protocol details to `houmao-adv-usage-pattern`, not to the touring skill.
- Route stop, relaunch, and cleanup follow-up to `houmao-agent-instance`.

## Guardrails

- Do not activate `houmao-touring` unless the user explicitly asked for the guided tour experience.
- Do not force a linear step order or restart the user from project initialization when current Houmao state already exists.
- Do not claim ownership of the direct-operation command shapes that belong to the maintained Houmao skill families.
- Do not invent top-level `houmao-mgr easy ...` or `houmao-mgr specialists ...` commands; reusable specialist and profile inspection lives under `houmao-mgr project easy ...`.
- Do not collapse stop, relaunch, and cleanup into one vague “manage agent” action.
- Do not ask terse operator-style missing-input questions when the tour needs first-time-user guidance; use the question-style reference instead.
- Do not route current loop planning or generated loop run-control requests to retired loop packages.
- Do not restate composed tree loop topology, run-control details, typed-template rules, direct-SQL state rules, or elemental local-close edge-loop protocol inline; keep generated loop planning on `houmao-agent-loop-lite` or `houmao-agent-loop-pro` and elemental patterns on `houmao-adv-usage-pattern`.
- Do not auto-run cleanup after stop or treat cleanup as safe for a live session.
- Do not reference paths outside `src/houmao/agents/assets/system_skills/houmao-touring/` from any touring content. The packaged touring skill ships through pypi as part of the Houmao distribution, so paths under `examples/`, `docs/`, `magic-context/`, `openspec/`, or any other development-repository-only location are not reachable after `pip install` and SHALL NOT be cited by `SKILL.md`, any file under `branches/`, any file under `references/`, or any future file added to the packaged asset directory.
