# Relaunch Agent Instance

Use this action only when the user wants to relaunch one tmux-backed managed-agent surface without rebuilding the managed-agent home. Relaunch can target either an active managed session or a stopped relaunchable lifecycle record; stopped relaunch revives the same managed-agent identity, session root, and built home instead of behaving like a fresh launch.

## Workflow

1. Use the `houmao-mgr` launcher already chosen by the top-level skill.
2. Recover the relaunch target from the current prompt first and recent chat context second when it was stated explicitly.
3. If the user is clearly asking for current-session relaunch from inside the owning tmux session, allow the current-session `agents self relaunch` form without requiring an unnecessary explicit selector.
4. If no explicit target is available and current-session relaunch is not clearly the intended valid path, ask the user in Markdown before proceeding. Prefer a short bullet list when you only need the live managed-agent name or id.
5. Choose a chat-session selector only when the user asks for one or a stored launch-profile relaunch policy should be left to the runtime default. Use fresh relaunch by omitting selector flags unless the user explicitly asks to continue the latest provider chat or resume an exact provider session id.
6. Build the direct `agents self relaunch` command for current-session relaunch, or `agents single ... relaunch` for selected-agent relaunch.
7. Run the direct command.
8. Report the relaunch result returned by the command. When the selected record was stopped, make it clear that relaunch revived the existing managed session rather than creating a new one.

## Command Shape

Run one of the direct relaunch commands:

```bash
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents self relaunch
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents single --agent-id <agent-id> relaunch
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents single --agent-name <agent-name> relaunch
```

Selector meanings:

- `new` starts a fresh provider chat for this relaunch only.
- `tool_last_or_new` asks the provider CLI to continue its latest chat when supported.
- `exact` requires `--chat-session-id` and resumes that provider chat id.

## Guardrails

- Do not guess which live managed agent the user meant.
- Do not require an explicit selector when the supported current-session relaunch form is already the intended path.
- Do not reinterpret a relaunch request as `project agents launch`.
- Do not add `--chat-session-mode tool_last_or_new` or `--chat-session-mode exact` unless the user asks for continuation, gives a provider session id, or explicitly wants to override the stored launch-profile relaunch policy.
- Do not add chat-session selector flags unless the user explicitly requested them or supplied an exact provider session id.
- Do not claim that relaunch always recreates a missing tmux session or otherwise acts as a generic fresh-launch recovery path.
- Do not describe stopped-session relaunch as a fresh launch; it is lifecycle revival of the same managed-agent identity.
- If relaunch is unavailable because the selected session has no relaunch posture or the current-session authority cannot be resolved, report that relaunch is unavailable instead of silently switching to a fresh launch flow.
