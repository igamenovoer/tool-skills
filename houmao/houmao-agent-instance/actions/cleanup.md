# Clean Up Agent Instance Artifacts

Use this action only when the user wants to clean stopped-session managed-agent artifacts after stop.

## Workflow

1. Use the `houmao-mgr` launcher already chosen by the top-level skill.
2. Determine which cleanup kind the user wants:
   - `session` for one stopped managed-session envelope
   - `logs` for session-local log artifacts
3. Recover one supported cleanup selector from the current prompt first and recent chat context second when it was stated explicitly:
   - Prefer `--manifest-path` or `--session-root` from recent stop output when present.
   - Use `--agent-id` or `--agent-name` when no durable path locator is available but the target identity was stated explicitly. These selectors prefer cleanup-capable lifecycle registry records, including stopped records preserved by `agents stop`, and fall back to bounded runtime-root fallback scanning only when no matching lifecycle record exists.
4. If the cleanup kind or selector is still missing, ask the user in Markdown before proceeding. Prefer a compact table that shows the cleanup kind choices and the selectors still needed.
5. Include `--dry-run` only when the user explicitly asks to preview cleanup.
6. Run the selected cleanup command. Session cleanup removes the stopped session envelope, retires the stopped lifecycle record by default, and does not remove the managed-agent memory root. Add `--purge-registry` only when the user explicitly wants to delete the lifecycle record entirely.
7. Report the resulting `planned_actions`, `applied_actions`, `blocked_actions`, and `preserved_actions`.

## Command Shape

Prefer the durable locators returned by stop output:

```text
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup session --manifest-path <path>
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup session --session-root <path>
```

If no path locator is available, use an explicit name or id selector:

```text
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup session --agent-name <name>
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup session --agent-id <id>
```

For log cleanup, use:

```text
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup logs --manifest-path <path>
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup logs --session-root <path>
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup logs --agent-name <name>
<chosen houmao-mgr launcher> agents cleanup logs --agent-id <id>
```

## Guardrails

- Do not route cleanup work to `agents cleanup mailbox`; mailbox secret cleanup is out of scope.
- Do not route instance cleanup to `admin cleanup runtime ...`; that broader maintenance surface is out of scope.
- Do not guess the cleanup kind or cleanup selector.
- Do not widen a vague cleanup request into session or logs cleanup without user confirmation.
- Do not assume cleanup is safe for a live session; this skill is for stopped-session cleanup only.
- Do not add `--purge-registry` unless the user explicitly asks to delete the lifecycle record.
- Do not create or search stopped-session tombstones, stopped-agent indexes, or unsupported registry state.
