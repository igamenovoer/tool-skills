# Validate Loop

## Read First

- `../reference/generated-contract-defaults.md`
- MUST READ: `../reference/runtime-mail-model.md`
- `../reference/platform-boundaries.md`
- `../reference/system-input-questions.md`

## Preconditions

- Generated execplan exists.
- Operator wants to check concrete pre-launch readiness before `launch-agents`.

## Inputs

Require:
- `<loop-dir>`
- `<loop-dir>/execplan/manifest.toml`
- generated execplan validation evidence or a current `validate-execplan` pass
- prepared agent/project-profile facts from `prepare-agents`
- prepared workspace facts from `prepare-workspace`, including current workspace-manager validation evidence or summary when managed workspaces are required, or explicit equivalent manual workspace evidence

Use when present:
- generated agent bindings;
- generated workspace contracts;
- generated run artifact contracts;
- generated harness docs or commands;
- mailbox, gateway, notifier, memory, and inspection posture reports.

## Checks

1. Confirm the generated execplan is validated enough for execution.
2. Confirm concrete agent/profile identities and project profile or explicit raw launch profile facts exist for every required participant.
3. Confirm generated and private skills are installed or project-scoped as required by agent bindings.
4. Confirm Houmao system skills will be preinstalled by managed-agent creation for each required participant.
5. When managed workspaces are required, confirm workspace facts from `prepare-workspace` or explicit manual evidence match prepared agent/profile names, generated workspace contracts, and generated agent bindings.
6. Treat a workspace-manager `plan` alone as incomplete readiness; require created workspace facts plus current validation evidence, an accepted workspace-manager summary/report, or explicit equivalent manual evidence before launch.
7. Confirm launch cwd and memo seed posture match workspace contracts when workspace setup adjusted those facts.
8. For mail-driven loops, confirm mailbox, gateway, and notifier prompt posture are ready.
9. Confirm generated notifier prompts tell agents which on-event skill to use and whether to run a follow-up on-tick skill after mail processing.
10. Confirm generated skills can locate the plan-local harness when they depend on dynamic objective, constraint, policy, state, schema, rendering, query, validation, or controlled-apply commands.
11. Confirm required harness commands or import posture are usable enough for launch and start.
12. Confirm run artifact directories, run id policy, payload paths, record paths, state paths, logs, evidence paths, and operator-note paths are ready when the execplan defines them.
13. Confirm state initialization is complete or has an explicit start-time initialization path.
14. Confirm participants are launchable; do not require live managed-agent sessions before `launch-agents`.
15. Confirm no generated runtime behavior asks agents to sleep, poll, tail logs, or wait in-chat for future mail or ticks.

## Report

Report:
- readiness result: ready, ready with warnings, or blocked;
- prepared agent/profile facts checked;
- workspace facts checked, including planned, created, validated, summarized, missing, inconsistent, or custom/manual evidence posture;
- generated skill and Houmao system-skill preinstall posture;
- mailbox, gateway, notifier, and memory posture;
- harness and run artifact posture;
- state initialization posture;
- launchability posture;
- blockers that must be fixed before `launch-agents`;
- warnings that do not block `launch-agents`;
- whether `launch-agents` may proceed.

## Constraints

- Do not mutate agent profiles, workspaces, mailboxes, gateways, harness state, run artifacts, or live agents as the normal validation path.
- Do not repair missing preparation from this page.
- Do not require agents to already be live; that is checked by `launch-agents` and `start`.
- Do not start loop work.
- Do not treat `validate-execplan` as a substitute for concrete runtime readiness.
- Do not ask agents to wait in-chat for later mail or tick work.
