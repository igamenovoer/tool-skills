# Generated Contract Defaults

## Purpose

Use this page when generating, validating, finalizing, or operating against generated `execplan/` contracts.

Use these defaults unless intention source or accepted clarification decisions choose an equivalent or narrower shape. Any equivalent or omission must be indexed or explained in `manifest.toml`, generated docs, or validation notes.

## Execplan Scaffold

- `manifest.toml` indexes generated artifacts, generated-source posture, and plan revision.
- Every emitted generated artifact directory has a concise `README.md` with only:
  - `Purpose`: why the directory exists;
  - `Contents`: files or child directories in that directory.
- `adrs/` records accepted execplan-generation decisions when `execplan-step-by-step` is used.
- `specs/collab/collab-overview.md` is the required process-first authority.
- `specs/` separates objective, collaboration, communication, state, workspace, run-artifact, and participant contracts when those concerns apply.
- `skills/` contains one flat directory of generated skills: `skills/<unique-skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Generated skill names must be unique after installation; encode purpose in the skill name or metadata, not in nested category directories.
- `agents/` binds concrete Houmao agents to participant instances, prompt sources, installed skills, notifier prompt text, and workspace policy.
- `harness/` exposes loop-local validation, dynamic lookup, rendering, query, and controlled record application through an explicit command registry.
- `docs/` explains generated contracts for humans but is not source authority; final docs live under named files, not loose unindexed notes.

## Participants

- Separate participant role templates, stable participant instances, and concrete agent bindings.
- Do not force a fixed participant topology or role count.
- Generate task-specific records only from intention source or clarification decisions.

## Topology And Routing Defaults

- Generated execplans record one topology mode when participant routes are non-trivial:
  - `tree-loop`: local-close tree or forest execution; normal results reply to immediate upstream.
  - `generic-loop`: directed routes may be non-tree or cyclic when context, dedupe, termination, and result routing are explicit.
- Store machine-readable topology contracts under `specs/collab/topology/` when validation or harness lookup needs them.
- `tree-loop` direct participant cycles are invalid unless an accepted normalization chooses an existing participant as relay, root, aggregator, or cycle breaker and records the resulting tree or forest.
- `generic-loop` cycles define termination, dedupe or repeat-visit posture, active ownership, and result routing before runtime artifacts are generated.
- Do not require a master, lead, coordinator, or root owner unless intention source or accepted clarification decisions choose one.

## Predecessor Context Defaults

- Generic-loop routes consider predecessor-context needs route by route or message family by message family.
- Carry selected upstream refs, summaries, artifacts, branch or commit refs, state refs, evidence refs, or current-hop deltas only when the generated process says the receiver needs them.
- If no predecessor context is needed, record explicit omission when the route is non-obvious.
- Do not force a fixed context bundle across every generic route.
- State stores compact lineage and refs; rendered mail or artifacts store readable context.

## Mail Schema Event Defaults

- Templated participant mail uses `schema_id` as the loop-local mail type.
- `specs/comms/templates.toml` maps template names to `schema_id`, schema path, renderer path, payload format, and reply expectation when applicable.
- Outgoing mail follows `TOML payload -> JSON Schema validation -> Markdown rendering -> Houmao mail delivery`.
- Rendered mail includes a parseable in-body `houmao-email-metadata` fenced block near the top.
- Generated on-event mail skills state their exact triggering `schema_id`.
- Unknown, malformed, operator-origin, or freeform mail uses explicit generated fallback paths only when needed.

## Bookkeeping State

Treat bookkeeping as runtime control-plane state, not working memory.

State stores compact facts:
- ids and refs;
- statuses and ownership;
- decisions and scalar gates;
- evidence links;
- transition audit;
- completion posture.

Mail, docs, and artifacts store rich material:
- prose;
- rationale;
- rendered Markdown;
- pseudocode;
- analysis;
- detailed evidence.

Important transitions must be reconstructable from:
- changed entity;
- source actor or event;
- new state or decision;
- mail, evidence, or artifact refs;
- timestamp.

Active ownership must be queryable enough for scheduling and recovery.

## Operator Control Defaults

When a generated loop has lifecycle or mode control needs:

- generate one loop-local operator skill named `<loop-slug>-operator-control`;
- put it directly under `execplan/skills/`;
- make it identify the loop slug, loop dir, manifest, harness, agent bindings, and supported lifecycle operations;
- keep platform mechanics routed to maintained Houmao skills.

Keep run lifecycle state separate from execution mode:

- `run_state`: values such as `not_started`, `running`, `paused`, `recovering`, `stopped`, and `completed`;
- `execution_mode`: `auto` or `manual` when both modes apply.

Mode meanings:

- `auto`: the default mode; notifier prompts are the normal wakeup path for mail-driven participants.
- `manual`: notifier wakeups are suspended or disabled for the loop, and the operator prompts bounded participant turns.

Rules:

- Default initial `execution_mode` to `auto` unless intention source, accepted clarification decisions, or operator-control state explicitly selects another mode.
- `manual` is not `paused`; pause blocks normal progress, while manual changes wakeup authority.
- Record mode switches, pause, resume, stop, override, and recovery as operator intent events when those controls exist.
- Generated harnesses expose mode and control context; generated skills do not infer mode from intention Markdown or static prose.

## State Contracts

When durable bookkeeping is needed, generate state contracts under `execplan/specs/state/`:

- `state-overview.md` for authority, boundaries, entity families, transitions, invariants, scheduling queries, and non-state content;
- `schema.sql` when sqlite is selected;
- `seed.toml` when deterministic initialization is needed;
- `invariants.toml` when validation needs named checks;
- JSON schemas for JSONL records when JSONL is selected.

Default state backend order:
- use sqlite when stable entities and transitions can be expressed as a clear SQL schema;
- use JSONL plus explicit schemas only for append-only, schema-light, or intentionally denormalized state;
- avoid unstructured ad hoc state files when sqlite or JSONL plus schema is feasible.

Consider generic families such as:
- plan metadata;
- process state;
- control state;
- participants;
- work items;
- handoffs or exchanges;
- communication payload lifecycle;
- attempts;
- decisions;
- evidence;
- artifacts;
- operator intent events;
- generic events.
- generic-loop lineage and visited node or edge facts when cycles or repeat visits exist;
- cycle iteration counts and active ownership when generic loops need them.

## Generated TOML

- New generated topology TOML uses `tree-loop` or `generic-loop` as the mode value.
- Validation accepts legacy mode aliases recorded by older artifacts: `pairwise-tree`, `pairwise-loop`, `pairwise`, `generic-graph`, and `generic graph`.
- Generated TOML sections have plain human-readable comments above each section or table-array header.
- Agent-facing or harness-facing TOML records include concise `description` fields.
- `description` fields, not comments, are the source for harness `--explain`.
- Private mechanical TOML files that are never exposed through harness commands do not need record-level descriptions.

## Skill And Harness Defaults

- Generated on-event skills handle one concrete incoming event or message family, perform one bounded role-owned action, then stop.
- Generated on-tick skills handle scheduling, reconciliation, timeout, completion, or "what now" decisions by querying harness control context when available, doing at most one pass, then stopping.
- In `auto` mode, on-tick skills perform notifier-prompted follow-up work.
- In `manual` mode, on-tick skills perform one operator-prompted pass: check relevant mail or state, act on one bounded item, send or reply when required, record through the harness, then stop.
- Generated skills query specs, state, or harness output for dynamic policy and runtime facts instead of copying constants into static prose.
- Generated harnesses may use `click` for modular commands, `jinja2` for `.md.j2` rendering, and `jsonschema` for validation when needed.
- Generated import failures should guide callers to install missing libraries into the active harness Python environment or use the Houmao uv-installed environment.
- Stateful generated harnesses expose normal participant access through commands for state initialization, validation, read-only query, record validation, and record application.
- Controllable generated harnesses expose read-only `control status` and `control get-mode` commands, controlled mode or lifecycle commands when supported, and participant-specific manual context when manual mode is supported.
- Generated harness commands that expose TOML-backed contracts support `--explain` when structured descriptions exist, with stable source keys in machine-readable output.

## Workspace And Runs

- Generated workspace contracts identify launch cwd, agent work roots, notes or knowledge paths, writable temp/artifact paths, shared resources, and read/write rules when applicable.
- Managed workspace contracts include workspace-manager inputs when applicable: workspace flavor, task name, repo or workspace root policy, concrete agent workspace names, easy profile or explicit raw launch profile names, launch cwd policy, bookkeeping directories, ignored transient paths, shared resources, and memo-seed posture.
- Generated agent bindings reference workspace policies from `specs/workspace/`; they do not replace the workspace contract.
- Generated execution preserves durable payloads, rendered outputs, send or reply responses, records, state files, logs, and evidence under a run artifact layout such as `<loop-dir>/runs/<run-id>/`.
- Omit unused default layers only when the manifest and generated docs make the omission explicit.

## Execution Stage Defaults

- `prepare-agents` materializes launchable Houmao easy profiles, generated skill bindings, definitions, notifier prompt paths, memo posture, pending cwd posture, and prepared agent facts.
- `prepare-agents` does not launch live agents as normal preparation behavior.
- `prepare-workspace` adapts generated workspace contracts, agent bindings, and prepared agent/profile facts into `houmao-utils-workspace-mgr` plan or execute inputs.
- Workspace readiness may also come from explicit manual evidence when the generated execplan records the required facts.
- `validate-loop` checks concrete pre-launch readiness, including mailbox, gateway, memory, notifier, harness, state, run-artifact, and launchability posture before `launch-agents`; `validate-execplan` only checks generated package shape and contracts.
- `launch-agents` launches prepared participants through maintained Houmao launch surfaces and reports live-agent/session facts without beginning loop work.
- `start` begins loop work by sending the first trigger after required agents are live; it does not launch agents.
- `prepare-agents`, workspace readiness through `prepare-workspace` or equivalent manual evidence, `validate-loop`, `launch-agents`, and `start` are separate ordered stages.
- `prepare-workspace` and `prepare-agents` do not call each other.
- Missing profile, workspace, mailbox, gateway, harness, state, run-artifact, launchability, or live-agent readiness is a `validate-loop` or `launch-agents` blocker, not a `validate-execplan` failure.
