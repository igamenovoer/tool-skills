# Houmao Project Manager

Use this Houmao skill when the task is about the Houmao project overlay itself: initializing it, explaining its layout, understanding how project context changes other commands, or inspecting or stopping project-managed agents through the selected overlay.

The trigger word `houmao` is intentional. Use the `houmao-project-mgr` skill name directly when you intend to activate this Houmao-owned skill.

## Help

When the user asks `$houmao-project-mgr help`, `help for houmao-project-mgr`, `usage for houmao-project-mgr`, `available functionality for houmao-project-mgr`, or what this skill can do, answer from this section before choosing a project action, reference page, command, or missing-input question. This is read-only help: do not run commands, mutate files, send mail, change gateway state, or alter managed-agent lifecycle state during help. If the user asks a concrete task such as "help me initialize this Houmao project", route to the matching workflow instead of stopping at generic help.

Purpose: manage and explain the Houmao project overlay and project-scoped managed-agent inspection or stop surfaces.

Available functionality:

- Initialize or validate a selected project overlay.
- Inspect project overlay selection, effective project-aware roots, and bootstrap posture.
- Explain `.houmao/` layout and project-aware command effects.
- List, inspect, or stop project-managed agents through the selected overlay.

Common starting prompts:

- `$houmao-project-mgr help`
- `$houmao-project-mgr project status`
- `$houmao-project-mgr explain .houmao layout`
- `$houmao-project-mgr project agents list`

Related skills and boundaries:

- Use `houmao-agent-definition` for specialist, profile, project launch, low-level role, recipe, or launch-dossier work.
- Use `houmao-credential-mgr` for project-local auth-bundle CRUD.
- Use `houmao-mailbox-mgr` for project mailbox administration.
- Use `houmao-agent-instance` for generic managed-agent lifecycle after project-scoped routing.

## Scope

This packaged skill covers exactly these project-management surfaces:

- `help` (read-only meta operation)
- `houmao-mgr project init`
- `houmao-mgr project status`
- `houmao-mgr project agents list|get|stop`

This packaged skill does not cover:

- `houmao-mgr project specialist ...`
- `houmao-mgr project profile ...`
- `houmao-mgr project agents launch`
- `houmao-mgr project credentials <tool> ...`
- `houmao-mgr internals native-agent roles ...`
- `houmao-mgr internals native-agent recipes ...`
- `houmao-mgr internals native-agent launch-dossiers ...`
- `houmao-mgr project mailbox ...`
- `houmao-mgr agents global|single|self|external ...`
- direct hand-editing inside `.houmao/`

## Workflow

Before starting the workflow, answer explicit skill-help intent from `## Help` and stop.

1. Identify whether the user wants project overlay lifecycle, project layout explanation, project-aware side effects, or project-scoped easy-instance inspection or stop.
2. When the task is explanatory rather than operational, load the narrowest reference page you need before deciding whether any command should run.
3. If the user really wants specialist/profile authoring, launch-dossier authoring, auth-bundle CRUD, low-level role/recipe editing, mailbox administration, or generic live-agent lifecycle, stop and route the request to the correct Houmao skill before continuing.
4. Recover omitted inputs from the current prompt first and recent chat context second, but only when the user stated them explicitly.
5. Choose one `houmao-mgr` launcher for the current turn:
   - first run `command -v houmao-mgr` and use the `houmao-mgr` already on `PATH` when present
   - if that lookup fails, use `uv tool run --from houmao houmao-mgr`
   - only if the PATH lookup and uv-managed fallback do not satisfy the turn, choose the appropriate development launcher such as `pixi run houmao-mgr`, repo-local `.venv/bin/houmao-mgr`, or project-local `uv run houmao-mgr`
   - if the user explicitly asks for a specific launcher, follow that request instead of the default order
6. Reuse that same chosen launcher for the selected project-management action.
7. Load exactly one action page when the task is operational, or the narrowest reference page when the task is explanatory.
8. Report the result from the command that ran and keep the renamed skill-routing boundaries explicit.

## Actions

- Read [actions/init.md](actions/init.md) to create or validate the selected project overlay.
- Read [actions/status.md](actions/status.md) to inspect which project overlay is selected and whether a stateful project-aware flow would bootstrap it.
- Read [actions/easy-instances.md](actions/easy-instances.md) to list, inspect, or stop project-managed agents through the selected project overlay.

## References

- Read [references/overlay-resolution.md](references/overlay-resolution.md) when project overlay discovery or env override behavior matters.
- Read [references/project-layout.md](references/project-layout.md) when the question is how files are organized under `.houmao/`.
- Read [references/project-aware-effects.md](references/project-aware-effects.md) when the question is what changes for other `houmao-mgr` command families once a project overlay exists.
- Read [references/routing-boundaries.md](references/routing-boundaries.md) when the task is close to a neighboring renamed Houmao skill and ownership needs to stay explicit.

## Missing Input Questions

- Recover required values from the current prompt first and recent chat context second, but only when the user stated them explicitly.
- If any required input is still missing after that check, ask the user for exactly the missing fields instead of guessing.
- When asking for missing input, use readable Markdown:
  - separate `Required` values from `Optional` modifiers
  - `Required`: values that block the selected project command, such as action, overlay target, managed-agent name, or stop/list/get selector
  - `Optional`: launcher preference, discovery mode, explicit overlay env, output format, dry-run posture, or skip choices; if none apply, say `Optional: none for this step.`
  - use a short bullet list when only one or two required fields are missing
  - use a compact table when the project-management lane or several required fields need clarification
- Name the command you intend to run and show only the missing fields needed for that command.
- Do not use this format for user-task or domain-intent questions unless the question is about Houmao runtime behavior.

## Routing Guidance

- Use `actions/init.md` only when the user wants to create or validate the selected project overlay.
- Use `actions/status.md` only when the user wants to inspect overlay selection, effective project-aware roots, or bootstrap posture.
- Use `actions/easy-instances.md` only when the user wants `project agents list|get|stop` through the selected project overlay.
- Route specialist authoring, `profiles`, `create-agent-fast-forward`, `launch-agent`, `stop-agent`, low-level `roles` and `recipes`, and `launch-dossiers` to `houmao-agent-definition`.
- Route project-local auth-bundle CRUD to `houmao-credential-mgr`.
- Route generic managed-agent lifecycle after project-scoped routing to `houmao-agent-instance`.
- Route mailbox administration to `houmao-mailbox-mgr`.

## Guardrails

- Do not guess whether the task is project explanation, project-scoped managed-agent inspection, or an agent-definition/profile task when the prompt is ambiguous.
- Do not treat `project agents launch` as part of this skill; that belongs to `houmao-agent-definition`.
- Do not treat `internals native-agent launch-dossiers ...` as part of this skill; that belongs to `houmao-agent-definition` subcommand `launch-dossiers`.
- Do not treat project-scoped launch-dossier `--auth` overrides as auth-bundle CRUD.
- Do not imply that `project agents list|get|stop` bootstrap a missing overlay automatically; they use non-creating selected-overlay resolution.
- Do not hand-edit `.houmao/` files when the maintained `houmao-mgr` surfaces already cover the task.
- Do not use obsolete `houmao-manage-*` identifiers as current routing targets.
- Do not skip `command -v houmao-mgr` as the default first step unless the user explicitly requests a different launcher.
- Do not probe Pixi, repo-local `.venv`, or project-local `uv run` before the PATH check and uv fallback unless the user explicitly asks for one of those launchers.
- Do not use deprecated `houmao-cli` or removed standalone CAO launcher workflows for project management.
