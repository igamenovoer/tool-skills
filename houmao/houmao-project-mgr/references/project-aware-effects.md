# What Project Context Changes

Use this reference when the question is what other `houmao-mgr` subcommands do differently once a project overlay exists.

## Project-Aware Defaults

When a project overlay is selected, Houmao resolves project-local defaults from that overlay for these roots:

- agent-definition tree
- runtime root
- managed-agent memory root
- mailbox root
- easy root

## Command Families Affected

- `houmao-mgr project agents launch` builds brain homes internally from the selected project without requiring direct brain-build commands.
- Public managed-agent birth is project-scoped; direct raw native/provider construction lives under internal native-agent plumbing when retained.
- `houmao-mgr agents self join`, `houmao-mgr agents global list`, and `houmao-mgr agents single ... state` use project-aware maintained roots when they need shared runtime state.
- `houmao-mgr mailbox ...` uses the project-local mailbox root by default when an explicit mailbox-root override is absent.
- `houmao-passive-server serve` and maintained manager commands use project-aware runtime roots when their documented runtime-root resolution needs them.
- `houmao-mgr admin cleanup runtime ...` targets the project-local runtime root by default.

## Important Distinction

- Project existence changes default resolution for these other command families.
- It does not mean every `project ...` command bootstraps missing state automatically.
- When the selected overlay does not exist yet, some stateful project-aware flows will bootstrap it, while non-creating inspection flows report or fail against the missing overlay instead.
