# Post An Operator-Origin Note

Use this action when the caller is acting as operator and needs to deliver one operator-origin note into a managed agent mailbox.

When the caller is outside the Houmao managed-agent runtime, or current discovery shows there is no usable live gateway for the current session, use the authoritative operator surface:

```bash
houmao-mgr agents mail post --subject "..." --body-content "..."
```

When the exact target managed-agent `gateway.base_url` is already known for this turn, `POST /v1/mail/post` is also supported:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$GATEWAY_BASE_URL/v1/mail/post" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"schema_version":1,"subject":"...","body_content":"...","attachments":[]}'
```

Use the exact `gateway.base_url` resolved for the selected managed agent when taking the gateway route.

This action is filesystem-only in v1. It delivers from the reserved sender `HOUMAO-operator@houmao.localhost`, refuses Stalwart-backed execution, and does not allow live TUI submission fallback.

By default, operator-origin posts use `reply_policy=operator_mailbox`, so replies to that message route back to the reserved operator mailbox. Use `reply_policy=none` only when the caller explicitly wants a one-way operator note.
